# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Overview and Deliverables
Researchers set-out to investigate the types of bacteria found in the belly buttons of participants.  Data were collected for basic demographic information that included frequency of belly button washing (WFREQ), and types and number of bacterial cultures found for each Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) identifier (ID). The top ten OTU-ID's were presented for each test subject.  The following deliverables were requested per participant in addition to the demographic information:
  - Horizontal bar chart showing the top ten OTU-ID's and sample values. Hover text included OTU-labels.
  - Bubble chart showing the bacterial cultures per sample for all OTU-ID's found. Hover text included OTU-labels.
  - Gauge chart indicating the frequency of belly button washing per week.

## Results
An interactive webpage was created that allows users to search by participant ID number from a pull-down menu. A horizontal bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart are displayed to show findings for each participant in the investigation.
